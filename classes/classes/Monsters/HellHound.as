Its eyes and mouth are filled with flames and its hind legs capped with dog paws, but its front ones almost look like human hands.  Its limbs end in large, menacing claws. A thick layer of dark fur covers his entire body like armor.  Both heads look at you hungrily as the hellhound circles around you.
